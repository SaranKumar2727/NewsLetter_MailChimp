# Newsletter
It is just a sign-up page by which anyone can get subscribed to your mailchimp account directly by signing-up here.
I have used mailchimp api to achieve this.
The project files are available on the master branch of this repository.
You need to create your mailchimp account first and then generate your api key.
Also copy the list_id of your account.
In app.js file you need to edit the following things:
    1.You need to replace X in the URL with the last digits of the api key.
    2.You need to keep your pi_key in place of password and you can write anything in place of saran (username).
    3.You need to replace list_id in url with your list_id
